			You can find the latest news from the other side of the planet in countless videos all over YouTube, and in even more articles scattered all across the Internet. 
			If you want to learn the right way to do something, there are lots of tutorials in both video form and instructions a mere Google search away. 
			If there is something you want to ask someone miles away, you can give them a text, an email or a call and the distance practically shrinks to zero. 
			There is so much information circulating around the web that spreading it is no longer a problem. Because of this, a new issue is surfacing: 
			how much information we find on the Internet is actually the truth? </p>

			How? We can do it with the knowledge of identifying the facts from the fakes! Here on the site, you can learn some guidelines on how to generally spot fake news and 
			how to identify specific kinds of fake news as well. </p>
