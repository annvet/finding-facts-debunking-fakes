			<h3 id="p2_step1_heading">Step 1: Grammar Check</h3>

			<p id="p2_step1_text">
				Grammar is a very important factor when it comes to news. Proper sources 
				make sure that their grammar is correct since this is essential for viewers to understand the 
				information properly. There are times when sources of fake news are able to do this as well, though. However, 
				most of the time, you can spot some easy-to-find grammar mistakes in their articles and images. You 
				can’t identify all fake news with this step, but it surely acts as a good filter. To end, if it's 
				been written so weirdly it's confusing, it probably isn’t true.

			<h3 id="p2_step2_heading">Step 2: Editing Check</h3>
			<img id="p2_editing" src="../images/Editing.jpg" alt="Editing" title="Photo from studiobinder.com. Retrieved October 22, 2020.">
			<p id="p2_step2_text">
				Most valid news sources have a good editing and graphics team working in the background, making 
				sure that the information is presentable and appealing to the public. If something looks like it was 
				faked, it was probably faked. This manifests in a variety of ways such as blurry images alongside 
				clear images, words with fonts that don’t actually match the rest, very bad green screen editing and 
				places that appear to have been covered with a color that someone attempted to match with the background 
				but didn't really match. Also, familiarize yourself with websites that are valid sources of information. There are 
				some people out there who copy the URLs and change them a bit so a not-so-careful checker can be easily 
				fooled. Just remember, if it looks sketchy, it probably is sketchy.

			<h3 id="p2_step3_heading">Step 3: Google Check</h3>
			<img id="p2_google" src="../images/Google.jpg" alt="Google" title="Photo from depositphotos.com. Retrieved December 6, 2020.">
			<p id="p2_step3_text">
				The last step is something applicable to information of any form one sees on the Internet: fact-checking. 
				You don't necessarily have to use Google since any search engine works. If your information passed the Grammar 
				Check and the Editing Check, you only need to do one last test before you either dismiss it as fake news or 
				accept it as correct: you have to search for more sources that state the same information. If the same news is 
				reported by commonly known news sources, your information is most likely true since news sources like that have 
				a huge reputation and have no incentive to start releasing fake news. If you aren’t sure whether 
				you can trust information from certain sites or not, you should do a background check on the author of the 
				information. Ask yourself, "Is this person qualified to speak about things in the field said information belongs to?" If they 
				are, your information is most likely true. If they aren’t, you should ignore that information. Lastly, multiple trustworthy
				sources should confirm your information. Remember, if it’s true, there usually won’t only be one person confirming it.
