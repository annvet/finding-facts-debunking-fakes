				From the start of the pandemic, many speculations have been circulating online about how the virus can be cured. Unfortunately, 
				not all of these are actually true! You will learn many things from social media, search engines or even your next-door neighbors 
				but keep in mind that not all of these pieces of information come from experts. Here’s a quote from Arlene Chai’s Eating Fire and 
				Drinking Water that captures this tip: “So listen all you like, but disbelieve all you hear… You are in the city of lies.”

				The only valid information about the virus is the information that comes from experts who have studied it. Only people who have done 
				extensive research about it are allowed to give confirmation about whether something works or doesn’t with regards to COVID-19. 
				Information from other people should only be believed if this information originally came from the results of proper researches made 
				by people qualified to make them. You should note that influential figures in either society or just in your life such as actors, 
				vloggers, politicians, relatives, friends and neighbors are not considered experts. Because of this, original information or information 
				sourced from actual experts but interpreted in a manner that means something different is not accurate and should not be believed.

				Let’s say you want to share to a family member some new information you learned about the virus. So you got your information from a valid 
				source? That’s good! You’re certain this source got its information from an expert? That sounds great! Are you a hundred percent sure that 
				you will be able to communicate accurate information to a family member? Well, not completely. How come? Are you sure that you interpreted 
				the information correctly? If you didn’t and your interpretation is different from message that the original information wants to portray, 
				you yourself might end up spreading fake news! Unfortunately, not everyone who tries their best to disseminate correct information watches 
				out for this, which is something you have to watch out for when hunting for information. You may get too comfortable noting that a piece of 
				information has a proper source without finding out that the information and the source have conflicting messages! That is why you should 
				always confirm with the original source before believing news you see on the internet.
