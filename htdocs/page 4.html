			<p id="p4_tip1_text">
				Gossip is something that preys on our minds, its palatability more welcome to us than the simplicity of cold information. While there 
				may be a little truth in the gossip, a lot of it is most likely imagined to fill the gaps between the bits of actual truth. As intriguing 
				and interesting as it may be, don’t believe anything without solid proof. In the absence of facts, we can only fill in the gaps, but it 
				is important to remember that our imagined truth is not truth until it is proven. It is merely speculation, nothing more.

			<h3 id="p4_tip2_heading">Tip 2: Beware Of Opinions</h3>

			<p id="p4_tip2_text">
				Opinions are something to be wary of when you are looking for news about politics and politicians. There are articles and posts where it 
				is pretty evident that what is being said is just the opinion of the creator, but there are some where it this information is rather vague. 
				Because of that, always remember to fact-check your information. However, it is not just other people’s opinions you should be wary of, but 
				also your own. Some people have a tendency to dismiss information as untrue or vice versa just because it goes against or coincides with 
				their political opinions. Remember that when getting updated as to what is the real situation, one must accept all truth and only truth 
				wholeheartedly. Do not protect your opinion from the truth, but use the truth to shape your opinions.

			<img id="p4_crowd" src="../images/Crowd.jpg" alt="Crowd" title="Photo from newscientist.com. Retrieved January 17, 2021.">
			<p id="p4_tip3_text">
				Politics has a way of tearing the common folk apart in a flurry of disgust and disapproval towards each other’s opinions. It brings people 
				with like opinions together and tears those with different opinions apart. This is evident in the springing up of multiple groups in platforms 
				such as Facebook dedicated to those political opinions. Considering the fact that these groups bring together people with common opinions, you 
				can expect that news (or even information) that comes from these groups will be biased towards the person or party the members support. In fact, 
				some pieces of information may be put there by infiltrators who have a differing political opinion in order to see how many people will fall for 
				the incorrect information. In other words, information that comes from groups like these are usually just bits of information, handpicked and 
				filtered, that strive to strengthen the opinions of the members that see them. They often hide the truth or frame it in a way that makes it seem 
				appealing. Do not rely on groups like these for information.
